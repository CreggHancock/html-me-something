                <h4>My Youth</h4>
                <p>We all have our obsessions. Everyone has a hobby they find themselves immersed in,
                     be it <em>sports</em>, <em>cooking</em>, or <em>writing</em>. I'm no different,
                 but being born into the dawn of immersive video games led
             me to just being a dork. Being the video game addict that I am, and was from the age 4,
            it didn't take long for me to want to build games myself.  Unfortunately, youthful me had no pc
            and no idea where to begin.</p>

            <p>Fast forward a few years to when I was 12. At this point I had already owned a at least
                a dozen game systems, and I could no longer wait to start making some of my own. I started
                off by trying to make a game system of my own, but when I (<em>with my limited knowledge of
                    electronics</em>) couldn't build anything but an engine that would spin disks around,
                    I decided to get a pc at a garage sale and build a game for that.</p>

            <h5>My First Game</h5>

            <p>After years of dreaming, I finally found my opportunity to make a video game when I stumbled
                across a piece of software called GameMaker. With this engine you could built a 2d game with
                simple sprites and all without a single bit of coding knowledge. Naturally I was sold immidiately.
                I spent the next year building all kinds of games from pac-man, breakout, and pong copies. After
                getting bored of the basic I tried moving on to more complicated games...which led to a brick wall.
                Unfortunately the combination of my lack of brain power and the engine being old fashioned led me
                to not being able to complete a single larger project. So being the child I was, I gave up and went
                back to playing games</p>

            <h4>Current Age</h4>

            <p>Even after all my obsessions with video games, I eventually gave up my dev dream to pursue more "<em>realistic</em>"
                careers. After dabbling in various studies, I still found myself pretty obsessed with gaming. Regardless
                it took me till I was 22 to rediscover my dream. After I downloaded a game on xbox called "Project Spark",
                which is supposed to be a game about building your own games and game stories, I found myself thinking about
                game design non-stop. I didn't sleep for at least a couple days, and instead I stayed up writing a full
                background story as well as researching everything I could about indie game design. Fortunately since about
                2010 indie game dev has boomed leading to a large array of game design opportunaties and markets. In fact GameMaker
                itself had been completely redone, with an addition of scripting functionality using it's own beginner oriented
                version of <em>C</em>. Being already accustomed with the user interface of GameMaker, I picked it up right away
                and began making my dream game.</p>

                <img src="images/lighting2.png" alt="My first serious game!">

            </p>In the past 8 months I worked constantly, between learning code and game design ideologies. I wanted to make a game
            that was a success, and by my terms of success. No I wasn't expecting to get rich (Or any money for that matter). I just
            wanted to make a game that young me would want to play. Something that I could find pride in. So far it has been a major success,
            and even though the game still has much left before it is complete, I know I have already surpassed my expectations. I also know
            that I officially found something that I love to do, and through coding I found myself at LaunchCodes. Soon enough I
            may even find myself coding in my career. Looking back on that, I know for certain that 6 year old me couldn't be more proud of me.</p>
